Remote Computer Access: Most of cybercrime incidents are committed remotely due to the perceived
safety, impunity and anonymity that the World Wide
Web provides. An individual with unlawful intentions, e.g., launching a Web-based attack or accessing
child pornography, usually commits the offence through
a remote connection. The Internet, Telecommunication
networks and the Dark Web are most frequently used,
while private networks (intranets) accessible only to an
organizationâ€™s staff can also be exploited.
