Cyberterrorism is a "premeditated, politically motivated attack against
information, computer systems, computer programs, and data which result in
violence against non-combatant targets by sub national groups or clandestine
agents."8 Independent hackers or government-sanctioned hackers use
cyberterrorism to attack governments or private entities. 88 Throughout the years,
numerous cyberterrorism regulations have passed in various international
forums.
cyberterrorists tend to be sophisticated hackers with
advanced understandings of technology, whereas almost anyone can use social
media. The number of potential violators in the social media realm is much
higher than in cyberterrorism. Finally, the link between the harm and the activity
in cyberterrorism is much more direct. A cyberterrorist violates the privacy of a
government or private entity, which creates a clear and imminent harm to the
organization or individual. In the context of social media, this is less clear. There
is no question that social media can lead to harmful consequences: people
joining terrorist organizations, beheading others, and then posting shocking
images or videos. But the strength of causation is weaker. Can social media be
blamed for someone wanting to join ISIS? It is possible the person would have
joined regardless from seeing stories about the organization on the news. The
same could be said about beheading videos; instead of posting the video on
social media, ISIS could send the video to news agencies. Due to these
differences, a limited treaty on social media would not likely encounter the broad
support the Convention on Cybercrime enjoyed.
cyberterrorists steal
information, while terrorists recruit and spread terror.
