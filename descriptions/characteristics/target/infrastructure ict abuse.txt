Infrastructure ICT Abuse or Exploitation: This target
refers to ceasing or interrupting the perpetual functionality
of critical infrastructure, by abusing ICT systems [43], such
as industrial automation systems. These are physical plants
through which physical processes are performed along with
computational processes necessary for monitoring and handling the physical ones [44]. Offenders aim to society in
general by potentially hitting such infrastructure of great
importance.
