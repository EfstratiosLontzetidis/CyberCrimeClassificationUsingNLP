A country is a distinct territorial body or political entity.[1] It may be an independent sovereign state or part of a larger state,[2] as a non-sovereign or formerly sovereign political division, a physical territory with a government, or a geographic region associated with sets of previously independent or differently associated peoples with distinct political characteristics. It is not inherently sovereign.
