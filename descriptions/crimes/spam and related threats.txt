Spam and Related Threats: Spamming is the massive emission of unsolicited messages that mainly purport
to advertisement, the most widely recognized form of
which is e-mail spam. According to the Messaging AntiAbuse Working Group and Others [80], from July 2009 to
December 2010, abusive e-mail ranged from about 88%â€“91%
in a total of 200 billion unaltered e-mails delivered from
500 million mailboxes. These metrics show that the majority
of e-mails can be considered spam pointing out the severity of
the problem. The offenders choose spamming to go after their
objective, on the grounds that e-mail distribution is inexpensive
as the marginal cost for each electronic message is essentially
zero. Moreover, the origin of spam messages is often difficult to determine, due to the use of unknown domains and the
proper concealment of the message source [81]. Regarding the
consequences, apart from annoying and distracting users, spam
messages result in direct financial loss for companies, reduced
productivity, and breach of individual privacy [82].
